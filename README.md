Personal Website
## Introdction
In this project, I used several libraries for website development. I used bootstrap to align different elements, which would make the page clearer. And I used Google Map API to show the places I have been to in all over the world. Also some fonts used in this website, I used Google font to make the page more pretty. PHP has been used in this website to divide different elements into different files, which you do not need to change in ever files if some small change is needed. Also another library called swipe box was used, to show some my daily pictures.
